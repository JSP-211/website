My Website
______________

RUN-DOWN
______________

This is just my first attempt at creating a full site using JSP/HTML/CSS.

Configured to run with Apache Tomcat 7. Written using IntelliJ IDEA.

AGREEMENT
_____________

By using this software you are agreeing that you will not copy the entire design of this site
as it was also built for personal use, you are also agreeing that if any code from this project
is used at all anywhere even the slightest bit, you must credit the author (sonikhak) who can be
found at the links below. These things were not put in place because of general selfishness but the
fact that this website was created for personal use and that I just love open-source and think people
should be allowed to learn from this or perhaps use some of it's concepts, if I ever change the design
of my site over at http://sonikhak.net/ then you have full permission to do whatever you want with this
site and you can completely disregard this license.

STRONG NOTICE: I CURRENTLY DO NOT OWN THE DOMAIN HTTP://SONIKHAK.NET/ SO THE AGREEMENT MUST STAY IN PLACE!
